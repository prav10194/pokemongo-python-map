# pokemongo-python-map
A simple extension of the pokemongo api to display a map with the Pokemons around your area. Also adding functionality to send notifications to mobile using twilio and PushBullet. 

Some stuff to take care of before using - 
-------
 * Works only for Trainer club account. Make a new account as there are chances of getting banned. 
 * Might show heartbeat errors as the servers are being updated
 * No farming/hatching/catching/spinning supported. You might need to look to other projects for that. (Refer https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongodev)
 * Refer to requirements.txt for extra libraries to install. 

Pre-requisites - 
-------
 * Python 2.7/3.4 
 * gmplot package to be installed from the zip given. (Added pokemon icons and made changes in gmplot.py)
